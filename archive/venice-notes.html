                <h1>Venice Notes</h1>
                <div class="blog-post-meta">Started October 2025, Still in Progress</div>
                <div class="blog-post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    <p>This is a set of notes from John Julius Norwich's <i>A History of Venice</i> which I've just started reading.
                    This will be used to note history and thoughts on Venice as I read along and the historical role it played
                 for posterity.</p>
                 <p> <br> </p>
                 <p>I think the critical importance of Venice is that it acts as the  'counterweight' of Medieval Europe
                    culture. By this I mean: it lies fundamentally in the center - between the Western and Eastern Roman Empire,
                    between the Islamic world and Europe itself. It is a fundamentally Eastern - an orientally-oriented state - in the 
                  midst of the West. It's a republic in a land of kings (both Medieval Europe as a whole and Lombardy especially). 
                    It's intrigues are built around this. It's just fascinating to dive more into it.</p>

                    <p>I didn't realize Marco Polo was Venetian. That's a very interesting part of this whole narrative!</p>
